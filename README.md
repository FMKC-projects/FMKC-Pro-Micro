# FMKC Pro Micro
The FMKC Pro Micro is a fork of the Goldfish type-C pro micro Rev C. The reason why this is forked is that at the time of writing, type-C Pro Micros are either A) really expensive, or B) ugly looking. This fork is planned to be a community-themes pro micro and hence also openly shared. We'll try to include everything so that you could make your own PCBWay (or similar) or order.

## Risks
At the time of writing, we haven't yet done a order of this fork. Despite when this run has been done and the files are "ready", you are still using this at your own risk.

## Repo Contents
**/cad** - KiCad source files.  
**/doc** - Schematics
**/bom** - The BOM-file as .xslx (or some other format)
